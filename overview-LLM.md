## 2. OpenAI

### 2.1 Company Background

OpenAI is an American AI research company founded in San Francisco in 2015. Originally a non-profit, it transitioned to a "capped-profit" structure in 2019 and has since attracted billions in investment, primarily from Microsoft. OpenAI is widely considered the originator of the modern LLM era — GPT-3 (2020) and ChatGPT (2022) fundamentally changed the public's relationship with AI. The company's models set the de facto industry standard against which all others are benchmarked.

With GPT-5.4 (released March 2026), OpenAI maintains its position at the frontier of language model capabilities.

### 2.2 Technology

**GPT Architecture:**
OpenAI's GPT series uses a transformer-based decoder architecture. GPT-5.4 features an extended context window of up to 1.05 million tokens and significantly improved instruction-following and reasoning compared to its predecessors.

**Models in the Client:**

| Model | Context | Max Output | Tier | Notes |
|-------|---------|------------|------|-------|
| `gpt-5.4` | 1,050,000 Token | 16,384 Token | Paid | Flagship model (March 2026) |
| `gpt-5.2-chat-latest` | 128,000 Token | 16,384 Token | Paid | ChatGPT-optimized version |
| `gpt-4o` | 128,000 Token | 16,384 Token | Paid | Omni — text + image input |
| `gpt-4.1` | 1,048,576 Token | 32,768 Token | Paid | Coding-optimized, 1M context |
| `gpt-4o-mini` | 128,000 Token | 16,384 Token | Free & Paid | Cost-efficient, high quality |
| `gpt-5-mini` | 128,000 Token | 16,384 Token | Free | Lightweight GPT-5 variant |

**API Endpoint:**
OpenAI uses `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions` — the original endpoint that defined the OpenAI-compatible format now used by most other providers. In this client, communication is handled by `openai-api.py`.

### 2.3 Pricing (as of 10.03.2026)

All prices in USD per 1 million tokens:

| Model | Input | Output | Free Tier |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| `gpt-5.4` | $1.05/M | $4.20/M | ❌ |
| `gpt-4.1` | $2.00/M | $8.00/M | ❌ |
| `gpt-4o` | $2.50/M | $10.00/M | ❌ |
| `gpt-5.2-chat-latest` | $1.50/M | $6.00/M | ❌ |
| `gpt-4o-mini` | $0.15/M | $0.60/M | ✅ (rate-limited) |
| `gpt-5-mini` | $0.30/M | $1.20/M | ✅ (rate-limited) |

**Note:** OpenAI pricing is the most expensive among the five providers in this client, but reflects the highest quality ceiling and the most mature ecosystem.

### 2.4 Strengths

- **Quality Ceiling:** GPT-5.4 represents the current frontier of language model capability
- **Ecosystem:** The original OpenAI API format — the most widely documented and supported API in the industry
- **Reliability:** Enterprise-grade uptime, well-established SLA, global infrastructure
- **Multimodal (gpt-4o):** Image input support alongside text
- **Audio Input (gpt-4o, gpt-4.1):** Microphone recordings can be sent directly to the model via the built-in audio recording feature of this client. Audio is transmitted as base64-encoded WebM/MP4 and processed natively by the model — no transcription step required.
- **Streaming:** Native SSE support, very low latency to first token
- **Context:** gpt-5.4 and gpt-4.1 offer up to 1M+ token context windows

### 2.5 Weaknesses

- **Price:** The most expensive provider in this client — GPT-5.4 costs 37× more per input token than DeepSeek (cache hit)
- **Free Tier:** Limited to gpt-4o-mini and gpt-5-mini with rate restrictions
- **No Permanent Free Tier:** Free usage is rate-limited, not volume-limited like Google

### 2.6 Ideal For

Users who need **maximum quality and reliability** and for whom cost is secondary. Also ideal for developers building on the OpenAI ecosystem who want a private, self-hosted frontend. GPT-4o-mini offers an excellent cost-quality ratio for everyday tasks.

## 3. DeepSeek

### 3.1 Company Background

DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company founded in late 2023, belonging to Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co. The company gained worldwide attention in January 2025 when it released DeepSeek V3 and R1 — models that reached GPT-4-level performance with significantly less training effort. This sparked a broad discussion about the efficiency of AI training and caused a short-term drop in Nvidia's stock price.

DeepSeek represents a fundamental shift in the AI landscape: high-quality models do not have to be expensive.

### 3.2 Technology

**Model Architecture:**
DeepSeek uses a **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** architecture combined with **Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)**. Instead of activating all parameters for every request, the model dynamically selects only the relevant "experts". This enables a drastic reduction in inference costs without significant loss of quality.

**DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA):**
Introduced in late 2025, DSA reduces KV-cache memory requirements by up to 57× compared to standard attention. This innovation allowed a 50% price reduction for the API.

**Models in the Client:**

| Model | Version | Context | Max Output | Capabilities |
|-------|---------|---------|------------|--------------|
| `deepseek-chat` | V3.2 (as of 10.03.2026) | 128K Token | 8,192 Token | Text only |
| `deepseek-reasoner` | R1 (as of 10.03.2026) | 128K Token | 64K Token (Thinking) | Text only + CoT |

**DeepThink (R1 Reasoning):**
The `deepseek-reasoner` model uses genuine Chain-of-Thought Reasoning. It "thinks" step by step internally before responding. This makes it significantly better at complex math, logic, and programming tasks, but also slower and more expensive. In the client, this mode is activated via the DeepThink button.

### 3.3 Pricing (as of 10.03.2026)

All prices in USD per 1 million tokens:

| Price Type | deepseek-chat (V3.2) | deepseek-reasoner (R1) |
|------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Cache Hit (Input)** | $0.028 | $0.14 |
| **Cache Miss (Input)** | $0.28 | $0.55 |
| **Output** | $0.42 | $2.19 |

**Context Caching:** Requests that share the same prefix (e.g. system prompt) are automatically cached. Cache hits cost 90% less than cache misses.

**Off-Peak Discount:** Between 16:30–00:30 UTC, discounts of up to 75% (R1) and 50% (V3.2) apply.

**Free Tier:** New API accounts receive 5 million tokens for free (valid for 30 days).

### 3.4 Strengths

- **Price-Performance:** Unmatched value compared to OpenAI GPT-5.4 ($1.05/M) or Claude Sonnet 4.6 ($3/M)
- **Reasoning Capability (R1):** Competitive with OpenAI o1 at a fraction of the price
- **OpenAI Compatibility:** Drop-in replacement for OpenAI-based code
- **Context Caching:** Automatic, no configuration needed

### 3.5 Weaknesses

- **Text Only:** No image processing, no audio, no video
- **Privacy:** Servers in China; data processed under Chinese law (see Section 8)
- **No Permanent Free Tier:** The 5M free tokens expire after 30 days

### 3.6 Ideal For

Users who want to process **high request volumes** at **minimal cost** and whose data does not require a high level of privacy protection. Particularly strong for programming tasks, text analysis, translations, and complex reasoning (R1).

## 9. Conclusion

All five providers are fully-featured, professional LLM services. There is no clear "winner" — each has its specific sweet spot:

**OpenAI** is the choice for maximum quality and reliability. GPT-5.4 represents the current frontier, and gpt-4o-mini offers an excellent cost-quality ratio for everyday tasks. The mature ecosystem and native API format make it the industry reference. `gpt-4o` and `gpt-4.1` additionally support direct audio input — this client exposes this capability via a dedicated microphone recording button.

**DeepSeek** is the choice for maximum cost efficiency and strong reasoning capabilities. Those who produce a lot pay the least here. The privacy topic (China) is real and must be evaluated individually.

**Google Gemini** is the choice for multimodal tasks (image, audio, video), very long contexts, and the best permanent free tier. All Gemini models in this client support direct microphone recordings — spoken input is processed natively by the model without an intermediate transcription step. Google's infrastructure is reliable and configurable for GDPR compliance.

**Hugging Face** is the choice for everyone who wants to explore open-source models without risking vendor lock-in. The broad model selection and transparent pass-through pricing are unique.

**GroqCloud** is the choice for maximum speed. Those who build interactive applications or simply dislike waiting will be impressed by the LPU-accelerated inference. SOC 2 and HIPAA compliance also make it interesting for enterprise applications.

**Practical Recommendation for New Users:**
Start with **GroqCloud Free** (free, fast, ready immediately) or **Google Gemini Free Tier** (permanent, multimodal). If you need maximum quality, add **OpenAI** (`gpt-4o-mini` for cost-efficiency or `gpt-5.4` for the frontier). Once you hit the limits or have specific requirements, decide purposefully using this overview.
